    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>Git is a version-control system, which means that you can track and monitor changes on your code. Git has other features like issues and pull requests too. Git is usually used for source code and collaboration between programmers, but you can use it to do whatever you want.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Why use Git?</h2>
    <p>Because practically everyone else uses it. There are other version-control systems out there, like BitKeeper and Mercurial, but they are pretty much non-existent.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Git was created by Linus Torvalds, who also created Linux, in 2005 because at the time, Linux's version control system was BitKeeper, which was proprietary.</p>
