    <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
    <p>GitHub is a place where you can put your Git repositories. You can put issues and pull requests there. Think of it this way. You have the code you're actually writing and testing on your Git repository, on your computer. Once you're done with your code, you upload it to GitHub.</p>
    <p>There are GitHub alternatives like GitLab and Bitbucket, but they aren't used as much. We will be using GitHub for this tutorial series.</p>
