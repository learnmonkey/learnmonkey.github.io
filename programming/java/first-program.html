<h1>Your First Java Program</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Writing the Code</h2>
    <p>Below is the code we will write:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-java">
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>Save the code in a file called <code>HelloWorld.java</code>.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Running the Code</h2>
    <p>First of all, you open the command line and navigate to the folder where you stored the code file.</p>
    <p>Then, run the following command in the command line, which compiles the Java code into bytecode:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-batch">javac HelloWorld.java</code></pre>
    <p>After you run the command, you should see a new file called <code>HelloWorld.class</code>, which stores the bytecode.</p>
    <p>Then, run the following command, which interprets the bytecode:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-batch">java HelloWorld</code></pre>
    <p>Once you run the code, you should see:</p>
    <samp>Hello World!</samp>
