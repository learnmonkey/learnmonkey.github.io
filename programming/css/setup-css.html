    <h2>How do I setup CSS?</h2>
    <p>It is actually very easy to get CSS setup. To do that, first, make a file in the same directory as your <code>index.html</code> file called <code>style.css</code>. This is where all of our CSS will go. Then, in your index.html file, add the following code into your HTML file's <code>&lt;head></code> tag: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /></code></pre>
    <p>We will discuss what this code means later.</p>

    <h2>Checking If It Works</h2>
    <p>Once you have CSS added into your HTML, add the following code into the a file called <code>style.css</code>: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-css">
body {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now, instead of your page looking like this: </p>
    <h1 style="font-family: serif">Welcome to My Website!</h1><br>
    <p>It should look like this: </p>
    <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif">Welcome to My Website!</h1><br>
    <p>We will discuss how this works in the next lesson.</p>
