<h1>Python For Loops</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is a For Loop?</h2>
    <p>A for loop is used to <em>iterate</em> through an <em>iterable</em>. An iterable is something you can go one by one through, which can be a list, a tuple, a string, or a set. To iterate through an iterable means to go one by one through it. Then, inside of our for loop, we can do something whenever we iterate through one element in the iterable.</p>
    <p>Below is the general form of a for loop: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
for [element] in [iterable]:
    # do something
    </code></pre>
</section>

    <h2>The <code>range</code> function</h2>
    <p>The <code>range</code> function is a built-in Python function which returns integers from a start number to an end number, where the start and end numbers are included. Below is the syntax: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">range(<i>start</i>, <i>end</i>)</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>range</code> function is useful for doing something a certain amount of times.</p>
    <p>If you put just one number in the <code>range</code> function, the <code>range</code> function will default to: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">range(0, <i>number</i> - 1)</code></pre>
    <p>It goes from zero to the number minus one so it's easier to go through a list.</p>
    <p>However, do note that the <code>range</code> function doesn't return a list. It actually returns an object of the <code>range</code> class. In order to convert it into a list, we can run the <code>list</code> function/class on it, like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
print(list(range(5))) # output is [1, 2, 3, 4]
    </code></pre>
