<h1>Discord.py Cogs</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What are Cogs?</h2>
    <p>Cogs are a way to organize your bot's commands into different sections, so to speak. Cogs are classes and then we can individually add them to our bot object.</p>

    <h2>Making a Cog</h2>
    <p>Below is an example of a cog: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
from discord.ext import commands

class SomeCommands(commands.Cog):
    """Some useful commands"""
    
    @commands.command()
    async def hello(self, ctx):
        await ctx.send("Hello!")
    </code></pre>
    <p>Let's break down the code step-by-step. First of all, notice that we have a class that inherits off of the <code>commands.Cog</code> base class, which includes all of the behind-the-scenes stuff for cogs.</p>
    <p>Then, inside of the class, we have a multiline comment called a <em>docstring</em>. Docstrings are what Discord.py uses for the built-in help command.</p>
    <p>Then, we have the commands inside of the cog. Notice that the function has <code>self</code> as the first argument instead of <code>ctx</code>. This is because we are inside a class and functions inside classes always have <code>self</code> as their first arguments. Also notice that instead of using the <code>@bot.command()</code> decorator, we now use <code>@commands.command()</code>. This is because we don't have access to the bot object inside of the cog class.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Adding the Cog to the Bot</h2>
    <p>Finally, we need to add the cog to our bot object. This can be simply achieved by putting the following line of code into our Python code: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
bot.add_cog(SomeCommands)
    </code></pre>
