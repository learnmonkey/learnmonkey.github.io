<h1>Discord.py Setup</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Creating a Discord Bot</h2>
    <p>To use Discord.py, we of course need a Discord bot.</p>
    <p>First of all, make sure you are signed in to Discord by going to the <a href="https://discord.com">website</a>.</p>
    <p>Then, go to the Discord applications page and click the "New Application" button, which is located left of your Discord avatar: </p>

    <p>You should then see a form with the name of the application. You can fill in whatever you want; it doesn't matter: </p>

    <p>Then, click on the "Bot" tab and click the "Add Bot" button: </p>

    <p>Now, you should see bot settings. Here, you can rename bot's username and change the avatars. Make sure that the "Public Bot" switch is turned on.</p>

    <p>Notice how there is a hidden token field in the settings. The bot token is basically the password for the bot and it is very important that you do not share the bot token. If you accidentally share your bot token, you can click the "Regenerate" button to regenerate the bot token.</p>

    <h2>Making a Server</h2>
    <p>Now, we need to make a server to test our bot in. Think of a server as a group chat but with more features.</p>
    <p>To create a server, we first of all need to make sure we are signed into Discord. Then, we can begin using the <a href="https://discord.com/app">web version</a> of Discord. You can also download and use the <a href="https://discord.com/download">desktop version</a> of Discord.</p>
    <p>Now, go to the left sidebar in Discord and click on the big plus sign. Then, you can follow through the form and make a server. The server name doesn't matter.</p>

    <h2>Installing Discord.py</h2>
    <p>To install Discord.py, run the following command in your command line: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-bat">
pip install discord.py
    </code></pre>
    <small>If PIP doesn't work, read our <a href="/programming/python/articles/troubleshooting-pip/">Troubleshooting PIP</a> article.</small>
    <p>To test if your install worked, try running the following Python script: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
import discord
    </code></pre>
    <p>If you don't get any errors, then you have corectly installed Discord.py. Great! Now, let's get coding!</p>
