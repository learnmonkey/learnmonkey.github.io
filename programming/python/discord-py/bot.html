    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>If we wanted to make a real Discord bot with commands and a prefix, we could do lots and lots and lots of <code>elif</code> statements in the message listener, but that would be pretty inefficient and quite ugly. Instead, we could've used Discord.py's built in <code>Bot</code> object and set a prefix and make commands much more easily.</p>
