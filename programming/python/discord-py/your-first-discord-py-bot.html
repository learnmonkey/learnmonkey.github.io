    <h2>Connecting to the Bot</h2>
    <p>To connect to the bot, we need to make a bot client with the bot token: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
import discord

client = discord.Client()
client.run("your bot token")
    </code></pre>
    <p>When you run the script, you should see your bot is coming online in the server.</p>
