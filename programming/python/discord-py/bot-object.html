<h1>Discord.py Bot Object</h1>

<section>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>If we wanted to make a real Discord bot with commands and a prefix, we could do lots and lots and lots of <code>elif</code> statements in the message listener, but that would be pretty inefficient and quite ugly. Instead, we could've used Discord.py's <code>Bot</code> object and set a prefix and make commands much more easily.</p>

    <h2>Using the <code>Bot</code> object</h2>
    <p>The <code>Bot</code> object is actually not in the main Discord.py package, but in a very useful extension subpackage called <code>commands</code> which we can import by doing: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
from discord.ext import commands
    </code></pre>
    <p>To create a bot object we simply write: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="$")
    </code></pre>
    <p>And to run the bot: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
bot.run("token")
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Adding a Command</h2>
    <p>To add a command to the bot, we now use the <code>@bot.command()</code> decorator for each of the bot command functions. Also, now our command functions need to have the argument <code>ctx</code> as the first argument. The context is basically the context in which the message was sent (channel, author, etc.) For example: </p>
