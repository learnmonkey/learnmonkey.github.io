<h1>Python Lists</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What are Lists?</h2>
    <p>Lists are ordered collections of elements. The elements can have any data type and you can mix data types. You can set, create, and remove elements.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Lists?</h2>
    <p>To make lists, we seperate our elements with commas and wrap the entire thing in square brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>), which tells Python that we're making a list. We can put whatever we want in there.</p>

    <h2>Getting and Setting a Value</h2>
    <p>Getting an element in a list is easy. You do it like this: <code>list[index]</code>. You replace <code>list</code> with the name of the list variable of <code>index</code> with the index of the element in the list. Indexes start at 0 for the first element and keep going up by one.</p>
    <p>Setting a value is almost exactly the same as setting one. We simply set the element to something. So, we do <code>list[index] = value</code>. It's exactly the same as last time, but we replace value with the value we want to set.</p>
