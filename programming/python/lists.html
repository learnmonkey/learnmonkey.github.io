    <h2>What are Lists?</h2>
    <p>Lists in Python are basically just lists of elements. The elements can be literally anything: strings, numbers, you name it. You can add and remove elements from lists.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Lists?</h2>
    <p>It's quite simple. We just seperate our elements with commas and wrap the entire thing in square brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>), which tells Python that we're making a list.</p>
