<h1>Binary Search</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll learn about Binary Search, a simple and speedy Search Algorithm.</p>

<section>
    <h2>What is a Binary Search?</h2>
    <p>A Binary Search is a simple and quick Search Algorithm. It searches for elements within an <i>array</i>, also known as a <i>list</i>, by cutting the list in half and searching half of a list for the element, and then cutting the list into quarters. Don't worry if you don't

    <h2>Binary Search Implementation</h2>
    <p>Due to its simplicity, a Binary Search is very easy to implement. We only need to <i>iterate</i>, or loop, over a list of elements and check if any of them are the same as the element we are looking for. Below is the implementation of a Binary Search:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
def Binary_search(arr, x):
    """Finds the index of x in arr using a Binary Search Algorithm"""
    for index in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[index] == x:
            return index
    return -1
    </code></pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Running the Code</h2>
    <p>The code is written in a simple function. It performs a Binary Search on the array, <var>arr</var>, and finds the first occurence of the value of <var>x</var>. If the element is not found, the program returns <code>-1</code>. Otherwise, it returns the index where <var>x</var> is found.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
    <p>The code for a Binary Search is very simple. On the first line, we define a function with <pre><code class="language-python">def Binary_search(arr, x):</code></pre> On the next line, we have a multi-line string. When you put a multi-line string on the line right after declaring a function, we call it a <i>doc-string</i>, which tells the developer a little bit about the function. Then, we have our main code:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
for index in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[index] == x:
        return index
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the code, we <i>loop</i> (or <i>iterate</i>) over the arry/list. For each item, we check if the element is equal to our target. If it is, then we'll return the index where we find it. WHen we return something in Python, we automatically break out of the function, so our function will return the first occurence of the target, if it finds it.</p>
    <p>Finally, on the last line, we have <code>return -1</code>. This will just return <i><code>-1</code> if the target is not found.</i></p>
