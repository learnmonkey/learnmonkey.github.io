<h1>Jump Search</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll learn about Jump Search, a simple Search Algorithm. Although it isn't widely used, it is still good to understand what it is and how to implement it, just in case you ever need to use it.</p>

<section>
    <h2>What is a Jump Search?</h2>
    <p>A Jump Search is a simple and quick Search Algorithm. It searches for elements within an <i>array</i>, also known as a <i>list</i>, and returns the index of a target element. It works by skipping through the sorted list by a certain number of jumps, and then looks to see if the element it is at is higher than the target element. If it is, then it will run a <a href="/programming/python/data-structures-and-algorithms/linear-search/">Linear Search</a> backwards until it find the target element.</p>

    <h2>Jump Search Implementation</h2>
    <p>A Jump Search is actually very easy to implement. Below is the implementation of a Jump Search, copy it down first, and then we will break it down:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
import math
def jump_search(arr, x):
    """This function performs a simple Jump Search on arr and searches for x withen the array.."""
    n = len(arr)
    step = math.sqrt(n)
    prev = 0
    while arr[int(min(step, n)-1)] < x:
        prev = step
        step += math.sqrt(n)
        if prev >= n:
            return -1
    while arr[int(prev)] < x:
        prev += 1
        if prev == min(step, n):
            return -1
    if arr[int(prev)] == x:
        return prev
         
    return -1
    </code></pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Running the Code</h2>
    <p>The code is written in a simple function. It performs a Jump Search on the array, <var>arr</var>, and finds the first occurence of the value of <var>x</var>. If the element is not found, the program returns <code>-1</code>. Otherwise, it returns the index where <var>x</var> is found.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
    <p>The code for a Jump Search is very simple. On the first line, we define a function with <pre><code class="language-python">def binary_search(arr, target):</code></pre> On the next line, we have a multi-line string. When you put a multi-line string on the line right after declaring a function, we call it a <i>doc-string</i>, which tells the developer a little bit about the function. Then, we declare some <i>pointers</i>:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
left = 0
right = len(arr) - 1
    </code></pre>
    <p>In our code, we use the pointers to keep track of the range in the list where the target element could be. The whole idea of using Jump Searches is using pointers and then keeping track of the range where our target could be. When the left pointer is greater than the right pointer, it means that the element is not in the list, so our program will return <code>-1</code>.</p>
    <p>By using pointers, we are able to determine which range our element is in. Then, we change our pointers according to the <code>if-elif-else</code> statements, so we can shorten our range until we find our target.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
mid = (left + right) // 2
if arr[mid] == target:
    return mid
elif target < arr[mid]:
    right = mid - 1
else:
    left = mid + 1
    </code></pre>
    <p>If we do find the target, we'll return the index where we find it. In Python, when we return in a function, the code will automatically break out of the function.</p>
    <p>Finally, on the last line, we have <code>return -1</code>. This will just return <i><code>-1</code></i> if the target is not found.</i></p>
