<h1>Searching</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll learn about <i>searching</i> and <i>search algorithms</i>.</p>

    <h2>What is Searching?</h2>
    <p>In programming, searching is simply looking for an element or a collection of elements in a Data Structure, normally a list. It's like looking for an recipe in a cookbook. THe different algorithms we use for Searching can be simple and complex. It add depends on the Searching method.</p>

    <h2>Why use Searching?</h2>
    <p>In programming, Searching is very important, but why? Well, let's say you recorded the favorite number of <var>n</var> people, and you want to find the first person who likes the same number as you, <i>32</i>. Sure, you could read over the list and find the number <i>32</i>, but that would take long. You can imagine that reading even a hundred numbers can be time-consuming, and you may even have bigger data sets of numbers. This is when Searching comes in. We can write simple programs to find occurences of data for us.</p>
