    <h2>What are Stacks?</h2>
    <p>Stacks are a simple but useful Data Structure. They're very useful in Programming Competitions.</p>
    <p>Basically, Stacks are like actual stacks. Imagine that you have some pancakes stacked on top of each other.</p>
    <div class="pancake" style="height: 150px; width: 250px; border-radius: 40%;">3</div>
