<h1>Stacks</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll learn about Stacks.</p>


<section>
    <h2>What are Stacks?</h2>
    <p>Stacks are a simple but useful Data Structure. They're used in Programming Competitions and Job Interviews, so it is a good idea to learn about them.</p>
    <p>Basically, Stacks are like actual stacks. Imagine that you have some pancakes stacked on top of each other.</p>
    <div style="height: 75px; width: 250px; border-radius: 40%; border: 2px solid black; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 10px;">3</div>
    <div style="height: 75px; width: 250px; border-radius: 40%; border: 2px solid black; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 10px;">42</div>
    <div style="height: 75px; width: 250px; border-radius: 40%; border: 2px solid black; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 10px;">-29</div>
    <div style="height: 75px; width: 250px; border-radius: 40%; border: 2px solid black; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 10px;">6</div>
    <div style="height: 75px; width: 250px; border-radius: 40%; border: 2px solid black; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 10px;">38</div>
    <p>With these pancakes, you can either put some more pancakes on top of the stack, or remove the pancake on top of the stack. It's the same with Stacks in Programming. It's "First In, Last Out", meaning that the first elements you add to the Stack will get removed last.</p>

    <h2>Stack Implementation</h2>
    <p>In Python, we can use <i>lists</i> to represent Stacks. Lists already come pre-built with the needed functions to make a Stack. So as an example, we'll use a browser history system to demonstrate the behavior of a Stack.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
history = [1, 2, 3]
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we represent our browser history with numbers. But, of course, you'd put the URL of a site as a string when you are creating an actual browser.</p>
    <p>Then, type the following code into your program:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
history.append(4)
history.append(5)
print(history.pop())
print(history)
    </code></pre>
    <p>After running the code, you'll get <samp>5
[1, 2, 3, 4]</samp> printed out into the terinal.</p>
    <p>On the first two lines, we call the <code>append</code> method on our <code>history</code> list. This will add the element we pass in to the end of our list. After running these two lines of code, our <code>history</code> list will be <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>.</p>
