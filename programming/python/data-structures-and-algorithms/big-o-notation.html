<h1>Big O Notation</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll learn about Big O Notation, one the fundamental concepts with Data Structures And Algorithms.</p>

<section>
    <h2>What is Big O Notation?</h2>
    <p>Big O Notation is a programming and mathematical concept which measures time and space complexity. Time complexity is the amount of time a function runs, and space complexity is the amount of space, or memory, a function takes up. However, the most used purpose of Big O Notation is for time complexity.</p>

    <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
    <p>Big O Notation doesn't measure the amount of time a function takes to run in seconds are actual time, but in measures of "O". For example, we could write "O(3)", meanning that the code runs a <i>linear</i> expression or code 3 times. It's okay if you don't understand right now, but at the end of this tutorial, you'll get the idea.</p>
