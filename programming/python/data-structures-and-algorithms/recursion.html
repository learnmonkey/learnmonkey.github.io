    <h2>What is Recursion?</h2>
    <p>Recursion is a simple yet powerful programming concept which involves functions calling itself. In most cases, you might make a function call itself to get what it returns under a specific test case. Many programming problems will involve recursion to traverse sub-objects or search a tree or graph.</p>

    <h2>Recursion Example</h2>
    <p>The most popular form and example of using recursion in programming is calculating fibonacci sequence terms. Here's some example code:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
def fib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    </code></pre>
