    <h2>What are Algorithms?</h2>
    <p>Algorithms are ways to calculate data or loop over something. For example, we might write an algorithm to find the average of a list of numbers, or create an algorithm to find the number of valid chess moves in a position. Algorithms can be both complex and simple. It is important for us to understand different algorithms because they make our lives much easier.</p>
