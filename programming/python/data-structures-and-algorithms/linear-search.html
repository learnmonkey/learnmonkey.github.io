    <h2>What is a Linear Search?</h2>
    <p>A Linear Search is the simplest and easiest Search Algorithm out there. It loops over an <i>array</i> (a <i>list</i>), and checks every item for the target element. Of course, it isn't very efficient if your element is at the end of the list and you have a lot of elements in your list. So, a Linear Search isn't often used in programming, but it is a fundamental idea.</p>
