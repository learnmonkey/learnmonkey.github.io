<h1>Linear Search</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll learn about Linear Search, the simplest Search Algorithm there is out there.</p>

<section>
    <h2>What is a Linear Search?</h2>
    <p>A Linear Search is the simplest and easiest Search Algorithm out there. It loops over an <i>array</i> (a <i>list</i>), and checks every item for the target element. Of course, it isn't very efficient if your element is at the end of the list and you have a lot of elements in your list. So, a Linear Search isn't often used in programming, but it is a fundamental idea.</p>

    <h2>Linear Search Implementation</h2>
    <p>Due to its simplicity, a Linear Search is very easy to implement. We only need to <i>iterate</i>, or loop, over a list of elements and check if any of them are the same as the element we are looking for. Below is the implementation of a Linear Search:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
def linear_search(arr, x):
    """Finds the index of x in arr using a Linear Search Algorithm"""
    for index in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[index] == x:
            return index
    return -1
    </code></pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Running the Code</h2>
    <p>The code is written in a simple function. It performs a Linear Search on the array, <var>arr</var>, and finds the first occurence of the value of <var>x</var>. If the element is not found, the program returns <code>-1</code>. Otherwise, it returns the index where <var>x</var> is found.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
    <p>The code for a Linear Search is very simple. On the first line, we define a function with <pre><code class="language-python">def linear_search(arr, x):</code> On the next line, we have a multi-line string. When you put a multi-line string on the line right after declaring a function, we call it a <i>doc-string</i>, which tells the developer a little bit about the function. </pre></p>
