    <h2>Running the Code</h2>
    <p>Run the code as you would run any other Python program. After running it, you should see a totally empty window like this: </p>

    <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
    <p><code>import tkinter as tk</code> tells Python to import Tkinter. We don't want to type the seven characters <code>tkinter</code> whenever we want to do something, so we import Tkinter as if its name was <code>tk</code>.</p>
    <p><code>window = tk.Tk()</code> tells Tkinter to make a window object, which represents the main window of the program.</p>
    <p><code>window.mainloop()</code> tells Tkinter to run a loop so that whenever the user does something, like click a button, Tkinter can respond.</p>
