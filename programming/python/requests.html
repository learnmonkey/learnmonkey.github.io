    <h2>What are Requests?</h2>
    <p>In this case, requests refers to HTTP requests. This means requesting stuff from a server over the internet. There are many different types of requests. <code>GET</code> means getting something from the server. You do this whenever you are visiting a website. Then, there's <code>POST</code>, which is for updating something on the server. <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and <code>PATCH</code> are other HTTP request types. However, <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> are the two most common ones.</p>
