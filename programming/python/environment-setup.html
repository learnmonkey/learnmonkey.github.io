<h1>Python Environment Setup</h1>
<p>Now, it's time to set up our environment.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Installing Python</h2>
    <p>Before you start setting up your environment, you, of course, will first need Python installed. If you don't already have it, see our <a href="/installing-python">Installing Python</a> guide.</a></p>
    <!-- <p>First of all, we need to install Python. So, go to <a href="https://python.org">python.org/downloads</a>. Then, click the big yellow button:</p>

    <p>After that, the Python installer should be installed on your computer. Simply run the installer and go through all the steps. For a more detailed explanation of the Python installation process, click <a href="/python/installing-python.html">here</a>. After that, Python will be installed. To check if Python has been installed or not, simply type in "Python" in the Windows search bar and see if Python comes up.</p>

    <h2>Installing Sublime Text</h2>
    <p>After getting Python, you will also need a text editor. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> is a great and easy-to-use text editor that we will be installing in this tutorial.</a></p>
    <p>After navigating to the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/download" target="_blank">Download</a> page, you will want to download the file for your computer. Once the file is downloaded, simply run it and go through all of the prompts. At the end, if it closes successfully, you should have Sublime Text installed correctly!</a></p>
    <p>To Open Sublime Text, just find it as you would any other app.</p>
    <h3>Congratulations! It's time to start coding!</h3>
