    <h2>Installing Python</h2>
    <p>To use Python, you must first install Python. To install Python, go to <a href="https://python.org">python.org/downloads</a>.</p>

    <p>Then, click the big yellow button. In the image, the version is 3.8.5, which may be different from what you see when you are reading this tutorial now. However, the version doesn't matter because we will be covering the basics, which mostly stay the same across different versions.</p>
    <p>After clicking the yellow button, the Python installer should be downloaded. Double click on it to run the installer. Now, the below should pop up:</p>

    <p>Simply click "Install Now".</p>
    <small>Note: it is very important is check "Add to Path". If you don't do it, you won't be able to run Python in the command line!</small>
    <p>Now, Python should be installing and there should be a green bar indicating the installation progress.</p>

    <h2>Installing Sublime Text</h2>
    <p>After getting Python, you will also need a code editor. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> is a great and easy-to-use text editor that we will be installing in this tutorial.</a></p>
    <p>After navigating to the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/download" target="_blank">Download</a> page, you will want to download the file for your computer. Once the file is downloaded, simply run it and go through all of the prompts. At the end, if it closes successfully, you should have Sublime Text installed correctly!</a></p>
    <p>To open Sublime Text, just find it as you would any other app.</p>
    <h3>Congratulations! It's time to start coding!</h3>
