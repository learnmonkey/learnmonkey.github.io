<h1>Python F-Strings</h1>
<p>F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6 as an improved way of formatting strings. Before f-strings, we would either have to concatenate a bunch of strings or use the <code>format()</code> method. Both of them aren't particularly elegant. So, f-strings were introduced. Using them is similar to using the <code>format()</code> method, but everything is more concise. For example, instead of writing: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
name = "John"
age = 36
txt = "Hello! My name is {name}. I'm {age} years old.".format(name = name, age = age)
</code></pre>
<p>We could write: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
name = "John"
age = 36
txt = f"Hello! My name is {name}. I'm {age} years old."
</code></pre>
