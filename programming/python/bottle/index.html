    <h2>What is Bottle?</h2>
    <p>Bottle is a super lightweight microframework for creating web applications with Python. It's super easy to get started. It, however, doesn't have a lot of bigger functions like <a href="/programming/python/django/">Django</a> so it is more recommended for beginners.</p>
    <p>Bottle is a <em>backend web framework</em> which means that Bottle runs the code behind the scenes. Backend means that Bottle handles all the user requests and the code on the server.</p>
    <p>Fun fact! Did you know that Bottle doesn't have any dependencies other than the Python standard library? It's true!!</p>
