    <h2>What is Bottle?</h2>
    <p>Bottle is a super lightweight microframework for creating web applications with Python. In fact, Bottle has no dependencies outside of the Python standard library. It's super easy to get started. However, Flask, unlike something like <a href="/programming/python/django/">Django</a>, does not have features like authentication built in.</p>
    <p>Bottle is a <em>backend web framework</em> which means that Bottle runs the code behind the scenes. Backend means that Bottle handles all the user requests and the code on the server.</p>
