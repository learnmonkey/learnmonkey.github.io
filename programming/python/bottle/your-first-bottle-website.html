<h1>Your First Bottle Website</h1>
<section>
    <h2>Writing the Code</h2>
    <p>Below is the code we will write: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
from bottle import route, run

@route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

run(port=8080)
    </code></pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Running the Code</h2>
    <p>Run the code as you would run any other Python program. Once you run it, when you go to <a href="localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a>, you should see <samp>Hello World!</samp> displayed on the webpage.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
    <p>Now, let's break down the code we just wrote.</p>
    <p>On the first line, we have <pre><code class="language-python">from bottle import route, run</code></pre> We do this to import a couple of different functions from the <code>bottle</code> module we installed in the last tutorial. The <code>run</code> function is used to run our server and the <code>route</code> function is used to create <a href="/programming/python/bottle/routes/">routes</a> for our server.</p>
    <p>After, we have </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
@route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
    </code></pre>
    <p>Notice how this starts with</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
@route('/')
    </code></pre>
    <p>This is called a <i>decorator</i> function, meaning that it modifies the <code>hello</code> function. In this case, it makes the <code>hello</code> function a route for our page. For the <code>route</code> function, we need to pass in a route for Bottle to use. The <code>/</code> is the home page for our server.</p>
    <p>After that, we define a function called <code>hello</code>. When we call this function, it returns the text <samp>Hello World!</samp>. When we visit the home page of our site, we will se the text <samp>Hello World!</samp>. Bottle will run this function and display whatever text it returns. We can also put <a href="/programming/html/">HTML</a> code in the returned string. For example, try putting <code>&#60;h1>Hello!&#60;/h1></code>. By running this code, we see <samp>Hello!</samp> displayed on the webpage as a heading (larger than regular text). We can also put HTML in <a href="/programming/python/bottle/templates/">templates</a>, as we will learn in another tutorial.</p>
    <p>Finally, we have <pre><code class="language-python">run(port=8080)</code></pre> This runs our website and the Bottle server. We previously already imported <code>run</code> from <code>bottle</code>, so now we can use it. In the <code>run</code> function, we have <code>port=8080</code>. By default our server will run on <code>localhost</code> with the default port, but in our case, we set the port to <code>8080</code>, so we can go to <a href="localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a> to view our code.</p>
