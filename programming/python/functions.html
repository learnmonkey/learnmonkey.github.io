    <h2>How to Make a Function?</h2>
    <p>To make a function, we use <code>def</code>, which stands for "define". After that, we type a colon and press Enter. Then, Sublime Text should indent the next line. This is because Python uses indentation for seperating blocks of code and this includes functions.</p>
