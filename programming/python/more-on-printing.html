<h1>More on Printing</h1>
<p>In the last tutorial, we learned that we could print stuff into the terminal by using the word <code>print</code>. In this tutorial, we'll learn a bit more about printing.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Printing Multiple Things at a Time</h2>
    <p>We can give <code>print</code> two things to print by separating them by commas.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello", "World!")</code></pre>
    <p>In the command line, the output is:</p>
    <samp>Hello World!</samp>
    <p>If you noticed, Python put a space between the words. If we don't want the space, we use <code>sep</code>, which stands for seperator. Going back to the Hello World exmaple, we type:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello", "World", sep="")</code></pre>
    <p>The output is:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">HelloWorld</code></pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Printing Without Endline</h2>
    <p>Python's <code>print</code> actually creates a new line after it prints. With the Hello World it might not be that obvious, but we can easily demonstrate it by using <code>print</code> twice.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello")
print("World")</code></pre>
    <p>The output is:</p>
    <pre><samp>Hello
World</samp></pre>
    <p>If we don't want the newline, we can use <code>end</code>. For example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello", end="")
print("World", end="")</code></pre>
    <p>The code returns:</p>
    <samp>HelloWorld</samp>
    <p>Note: you can actually change <code>end</code> to be anything. I'd recommend you not do that though.</p>
