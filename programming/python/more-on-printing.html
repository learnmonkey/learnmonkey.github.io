<h1>More on Printing</h1>
<p>In the last tutorial, we learned that we could print stuff into the terminal by using the word <code>print</code>. In this tutorial, we'll learn a bit more about printing.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Printing Multiple Things at a Time</h2>
    <p>We can give <code>print</code> two things to print by separating them by commas.</p>
    <p>For example, we can do <code>print("Hello", "World!")</code>. In the command line, it prints out <samp>Hello World!</samp>.</p>
    <p>If you noticed, Python put a space between the words. If we don't want the space, we use <var>sep</var>, which stands for seperator. Going back to the Hello World exmaple, we do <code>print("Hello", "World", sep="")</code> and we get back <samp>HelloWorld</samp>.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Printing Without Endline</h2>
    <p>Python's <code>print</code> actually creates a new line after it prints. With the Hello World it might not be that obvious, but we can easily demonstrate it by printing two things.</p>
    <p>If we do <pre><code>print("Hello")
print("World")</code></pre> we see: <pre><samp>
Hello
World
    </samp></pre></p>
    <p>Well, what if we don't want the newline at the end? It's actually very simple. Going back to our Hello World example, we change it to 
        <pre><code>print("Hello", end="")
print("World", end="")</code></pre> we get <samp>HelloWorld</samp>.
    </p>
    <p>Note: you can actually change the <var>end</var> to be anything. I'd recommend you not do that though.</p>
