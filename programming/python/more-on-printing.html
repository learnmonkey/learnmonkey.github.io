<h1>More on Printing</h1>
<p>In the last tutorial, we learned that we could print stuff into the command line by using the word <code>print</code>. In this tutorial, we'll learn a bit more about printing.</p>

    <h2>Printing Multiple Things at a Time</h2>
    <p>We can give <code>print</code> two things to print by separating them by commas.</p>
    <p>For example, we can do <code>print("Hello", "World!")</code>. In the command line, it prints out <code>Hello World!</code>.</p>
    <p>If you noticed, Python put a space between the words.</p>
