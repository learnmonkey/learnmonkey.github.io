<h1>Password Generaor</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll create a password generator in Python that prompts the user for details such as the length of the password, the number of digits, the number of letters, etc. The password generator will run in the command line, so we are making a <i>command line interface</i> (CLI) program.</p>

    <h2>The <code>string</code> Module</h2>
    <p>In order to generate a random pasword, we'll need to allow the user to specify how many letters or digits or special characters to put in the password. To do so, we'll need to have the letters/digits/characters on hand for us to access. We can do this by using the <code>string</code> module that comes built-in with your default Python installation. We can use the <code>string</code> module by importing it.</p>
