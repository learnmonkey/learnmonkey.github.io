<h1>Simple Autoclicker</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we will be using Python to create a simple autoclicker program, or a program that clicks (the mouse) for us.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Installing The Needed Modules/Libraries</h2>
    <p>In order for us to create our autoclicker, we'll need to install a couple of Python libraries using <code>pip</code>. To do so, you can open your command prompt/terminal and type the following commands:</p>
    <code>pip install pyautogui<br>
pip install keyboard</code>
    <p>If the commands don't work for you, go <a href="/programming/python/articles/troubleshooting-pip/">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Using The Modules</h2>
    <p>Now, let's discuss how our program will work. We've already installed the required modules, so, how will they work in our program?</p>
    <p>Well, the <code>keyboard</code> modules is used for methods in the keyboard. We're using it for detecting key presses so when the user holds a specific key, the program will now and it will boot the autoclicker and start clicking.</p>
    <p>The <code>pyautogui</code> module is used for <i>automation</i>, such as clicking, typing, and moving the mouse. We'll be using <code>pyautogui</code> for clicking the mouse.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>Below is the implementation of the autoclicker:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
import pyautogui
import keyboard
key = input("Auto Clicker Key Bind: ")
button = input("Which Button? 'primary' For Left Button And 'right' For Right Button. ")
while True:
    if keyboard.is_pressed(key):
        pyautogui.click(button=button)
    </code></pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Code Result</h2>
    <p>When you run the code, the program will prompt you for a key bind, or a key that you hold in order for the code to click. Then, it asks you for which button to click, left or right.</p>
    <p>Try typing "<code>c</code>" as the key bind and type "<code>primary</code> as the button, and then hold the <code>c</code> key on your keyboard. You'll notice that the mouse is clicking!</p>

    <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
    <p>The program is actually very simple</p>
