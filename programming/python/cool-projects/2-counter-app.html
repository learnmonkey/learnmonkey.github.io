    <h2>The Tkinter Module</h2>
    <p>In this tutorial, we'll be using the Tkinter module for making graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In the last project, where we made a number guessing game, we put our game in the command line, so we made a command line interface (CLIs).</p>
    <p>Tkinter is a built in Python module for creating GUIs. Although the apps that Tkinter makes aren't the prettiest, they are a good starting point and is very beginner-friendly.</p>
