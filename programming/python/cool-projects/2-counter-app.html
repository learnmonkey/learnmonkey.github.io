<h1>Python Counter App</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we will be using the Python Tkinter module to create a simple app that counts how many times the user has clicked a button.</p>

    <h2>The Tkinter Module</h2>
    <p>In this tutorial, we'll be using the Tkinter module for making graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In the last project, where we made a number guessing game, we put our game in the command line, so we made a command line interface (CLIs).</p>
    <p>Tkinter is a built in Python module for creating GUIs. Although the apps that Tkinter makes aren't the prettiest, they are a good starting point and is very beginner-friendly.</p>
    <p>If you want to learn more about the Tkinter module and all of its features, check out the <a href="/programming/python/tkinter/">Tkinter</a> tutorial series on Learnmonkey.</p>
    <p>Tkinter is built-in, so we don't need to install anything.</p>

    <h2>Writing the Code</h2>
    <p>Below is our code: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

counter = tk.Label(text="0")
counter.pack()

def increment_counter():
    counter['text'] = int(counter['text']) + 1

button = tk.Button(text="Click Me!", command=increment_counter)
button.pack()

window.mainloop()
    </code></pre>
    <p>When you run it, you should see something like: </p>
    <img src="/images/programming/python/cool-projects/counter-app.png" alt="Screenshot of the Tkinter counter app">
    <p>If you click the button, you should see the count above the button increase by one.</p>
