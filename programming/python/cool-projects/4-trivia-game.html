<h1>Python Trivia Game</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll create a simple <i>command line interface</i> (CLI) program that runs a quick game of trivia.</p>

    <h2>Making Questions</h2>
    <p>For our trivia game, we'll need to make some questions and store them for our program to access. We'll have them in this format:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
questions = [{"question" : "Who created Python?", "possible" : ["Guido Van Rossum", "James Gosling", "Donald Knuth", "Dennis Ritchie"], "correct" : "Guido Van Rossum"}]
    </code></pre>
