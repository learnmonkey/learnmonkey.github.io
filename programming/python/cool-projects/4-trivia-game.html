<h1>Python Trivia Game</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll create a simple <i>command line interface</i> (CLI) program that runs a quick game of trivia.</p>

    <h2>Making Questions</h2>
    <p>For our trivia game, we'll need to make some questions and store them for our program to access. We'll have them in this format:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
questions = [{"question" : "Who created Python?", "possible" : ["Guido Van Rossum", "James Gosling", "Donald Knuth", "Dennis Ritchie"], "correct" : "Guido Van Rossum"}, {"question" : "What is the oldest American university?", "possible" : ["Harvard University", "Yale University", "College of William and Mary", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "correct" : "Harvard University"}]
    </code></pre>
    <p>Notice how the <code>questions</code> variable is a list of dictionaries, which contain the question name, possible answers, and correct answer.</p>
    <p>We will then put this in a Python file called <code>questions.py</code> so we can more easily access it. So, whenever we need to access the questions, we can simply type <code>import questions</code> and use it as <code>questions.questions</code>.</p>
