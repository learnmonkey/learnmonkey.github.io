<h1>Python Trivia Game</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll create a simple <i>command line interface</i> (CLI) program that runs a quick game of trivia.</p>

    <h2>Making Questions</h2>
    <p>For our trivia game, we'll need to make some questions and store them for our program mto access. We'll have them in this format:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
questions = [{"question" : "Who created Python?", "possible" : ["Guido Van Rossum", "James Gosling", "Donald Knuth", "Dennis Ritchie"], "correct" : "Guido Van Rossum"}, {"question" : "What is the oldest American university?", "possible" : ["Harvard University", "Yale University", "College of William and Mary", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "correct" : "Harvard University"}]
    </code></pre>
    <p>Notice how the <code>questions</code> variable is a list of dictionaries, which contain the question name, possible answers, and correct answer.</p>
    <p>We will then put this in a Python file called <code>questions.py</code> so we can more easily access it. So, whenever we need to access the questions, we can simply type <code>import questions</code> and use it as <code>questions.questions</code>.</p>

    <h2>Making the App</h2>
    <p>Now, it's time to make our app, which will run in the command line. First of all, we need to import the things we need: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
import questions
import random
    </code></pre>
    <p>We will be using the <code>random</code> module to randomize the questions and answers.</p>
    <p>Then, we wrap the rest of our code to ask the player a question in a giant <code>while True</code> loop, so that our app will ask the player a question one after another: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
while True:
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now, inside the loop, we use the <code>random.choice()</code> function to choose a random question from our list of random questions and print the name of the question: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
current_question = random.choice(questions.questions)
print(current_question['question'])
    </code></pre>
    <p>We then use the <code>random.shuffle()</code> function to randomly reorganize the list of answers. We also declare a variable called <code>answers</code> so we don't have to repeat ourselves: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
random.shuffle(current_question['answers'])
answers = current_question['answers']
    </code></pre>
