<h1>Number Guessing Game</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll create a simple number guessing game that will have the user guess a number between 1 and 100. It'll run in the console so we don't need to make a <i>UI</i>, or User Interface. It's pretty simple to create, recommended for beginners.</p>

    <h2>The <code>random</code> module</h2>
    <p>In order to gnerate or random numbers, we need to use the built-in Python module <code>random</code>. It's used for generating random data, such as random integers and choosing random elements from a list.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Generating Random Numbers</h2>
    <p>In the <code>random</code> module, we have a useful function called <code>randint</code> which takes two parameters (two numbers), <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and generates a random integer (whole number) between them inclusive. So, for example, I could run <code>randint(5, 10)</code> and get <code>5</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>9</code>, or <code>10</code>. This is what we are going to use in our game.</p>

    <h2>Using <code>randint</code></h2>
    <p>We've already discussed how <code>randint</code> works, so now let's implement our game!</p>
    <p>before we start using <code>randint</code> and the <code>random</code> module, we'll need to import it. We can simply do this by writing</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">import random</code></pre>
    <p>After, we can access the <code>randint</code> function using <code>random.randint</code>.</p>
    <p>So, therefore, we can generate a random number between 1 and 100 using</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">num = random.randint(1, 100)</code></pre>
    <p>We save the number into the variable <code>num</code> for use in our game</p>
