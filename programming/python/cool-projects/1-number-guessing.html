<h1>Number Guessing Game</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll create a simple number guessing game that will have the user guess a number between 1 and 100. It'll run in the console so we don't need to make a <i>UI</i>, or User Interface. It's pretty simple to create, recommended for beginners.</p>

    <h2>The <code>random</code> module</h2>
    <p>In order to gnerate or random numbers, we need to use the built-in Python module <code>random</code>. It's used for generating random data, such as random integers and choosing random elements from a list.</p>

    <h2>Generating Random Numbers</h2>
    <p>In the <code>random</code> module, we have a useful function called <code>randint</code> which takes two parameters (two numbers), <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and generates a random integer (whole number) between them inclusive. So, for example, I could run <code>randint(5, 10)</code> and get <code>5</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>9</code>, or <code>10</code>. This is what we are going to use in our game.</p>
