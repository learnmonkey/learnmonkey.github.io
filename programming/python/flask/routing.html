<h1>Routing</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is Routing?</h2>
    <p>Routing simply means returning code (or HTML pages) when someone visits a specific URL on your site. For example, in the previous tutorial, we had one route: the <code>/</code> route which was our home page. In this tutorial, we will learn a little bit more about routing with Flask.</p>

    <h2>Making Routes In Flask</h2>
    <p>Flask is a <em>backend web framework</em> which means that Flask runs the code behind the scenes. Backend means that Flask handles all the user requests and the code on the server.</p>
    <p>In Flask, we create routes to handle what happens when the user goes to a particular address. For example, if we wanted to return "Hello World" every time the user visits the route <code>localhost:8080/hello-world/</code>, we would type: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/hello-world")
def hello_world():
    return "Hello World"

app.run(port=8080)
    </code></pre>
    <p><code>@app.route("/hello-world/")</code> is a decorator, which tells Python to change the behavior of the next function. Here, it makes Flask run the next function whenver we visit <code>/hello-world</code>.</p>
    <p>Then, we actually declare the function. The name of the function actually doesn't matter, but it's always good to have descriptive names.</p>
    <p>Flask gets the return value of the shows it to the user. Now, when we visit <code>localhost:8080/hello-world</code>, we see "Hello World".</p>

    <h2>URL Variables</h2>
    <p>In Flask, we can put variables in the URL of a route. For example: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/hello/&lt;name>")
def hello_world(name):
    return "Hello " + name + "!"

app.run(port=8080)
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the above code, whenever we go to <code>localhost:8080/hello/Learnmonkey</code>, we would see "Hello Learnmonkey!". If we now go to <code>localhost:8080/hello/John</code> we would see "Hello John!". As you can see, the text that is being displayed corresponds to the URL, but we didn't need to hard-code every single thing that the user might enter.</p>

    <h2><code>/page</code> vs <code>/page/</code></h2>
    <p>There is a difference between <code>/page</code> and <code>/page/</code>. If use <code>/page</code>, <code>/page</code> will work but <code>/page/</code> will not. However, if we use <code>/page/</code>, both <code>/page</code> and <code>/page/</code> will work (albeit <code>/page</code> will redirect to <code>/page/</code>)</p>
