    <h2>What is Routing?</h2>
    <p>Routing simply means returning code (or HTML pages) when someone visits a specific URL on your site. For example, in the previous tutorial, we had one route: the <code>/</code> route which was our home page. In this tutorial, we will learn a little bit more about routing with Flask.</p>

    <h2>Making Routes In Flask</h2>
    <p>Flask is what we call a <i>Backend Web Framework</i>, or a framework for creating the backend code for a site. Backend is handling the user requests and the code on the server. <i>Frontend</i> programming is creating the actual user interface, or the <a href="/programming/html/">HTML</a> code, on the site. Anyways, how do you make routes in Flask? Well, we simply type <pre><code class="language-python">@app.route("/my-route")</code></pre> and then followed by a function. In that function, we will return HTML code as a string. You can also return HTML code as a <i>template</i>, as we will learn in the <i><a href="/programming/python/flask/templating/">next tutorial</a></i>. As an example, type the following code <b>AFTER</b> the <code>hello_world</code> function from the last tutorial:</code></p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
@app.route("/say-hi")
def say_hi():
    return "Hi"

@app.route("/hello-there/")
def hello_there():
    return "Hello There"

@app.route("/greet/&lt;name>")
def greet(name):
    return f"Hi There, {name}!"
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now, once you have finished copying that code down and have ran it, we can start experimenting with routes!</p>
