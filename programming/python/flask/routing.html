    <h2>What is Routing?</h2>
    <p>Routing simply means returning code (or web pages) when someone visits yours site. For example, in the previous tutorial, we had one route: the <code>/</code> route which is our home page. In this tutorial, we will learn a little bit more about routing with Flask.</p>
