<h1>Flask Setup</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Installing Flask</h2>
    <p>Before get to using Flask, we of course need to install Flask. Since Flask is a Python module, we can use <code>pip</code> to install it. So, we run <code>pip install flask</code> in the command line.</p>
    <p>Once it is finished, Flask will be installed.</p>

    <h2>Installing a Code Editor</h2>
    <small>You can skip this section if you already have a code editor installed.</small>
    <p>Code editors are a great way to increase your efficiency and are also great for beginners. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> is a great and easy-to-use text editor that we will be installing in this tutorial.</a></p>
    <p>After navigating to the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/download" target="_blank">Download</a> page, you will want to download the file for your computer. Once the file is downloaded, simply run it and go through all of the prompts. At the end, if it closes successfully, you should have Sublime Text installed correctly!</p>
    <p>To open Sublime Text, just find it as you would any other app.</p>
    <h3>Congratulations! It's time to start coding!</h3>
