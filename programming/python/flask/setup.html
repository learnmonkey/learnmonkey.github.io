    <h2>Installing Flask</h2>
    <p>Before get to using Flask, we of course need to install Flask. Since Flask is a Python module, we can use <code>pip</code> to install it. So, we run <code>pip install flask</code> in the command line.</p>
    <p>Once it is finished, Flask should be installed. If it doesn't work, go <a href="/programming/python/articles/troubleshooting-pip/">here</a>.</p>
