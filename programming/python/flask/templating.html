    <h2>What is Templating?</h2>
    <p>Templating is returning HTML code when someone visits a route on your site. A template is useful when you want to return an actual HTML site and not just some text. For example, you might have an e-commerce site, but you don't want to just write your HTML code in your Python file. Instead, you can just use an external <i>template</i> and return that instead.</p>

    <h2>Making Templates in Flask</h2>
    <p>To make a template in Flask, you will first need to create a <i>directory</i>, or folder, named <code>templates</code>. You can write your HTML code in your <code>templates</code> folder. For this tutorial, we will create our Home Page using a template.</p>
    <p>First, let's make a file called <code>index.html</code>. We will write <a href="/programming/html/">HTML</a> code in there. If you are unfamiliar with HTML but want to learn it, then check out our <a href="/programming/html/">HTML</a> tutorial. But, now, copy the following code into your HTML file:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
  &lt;head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;h1>Welcome To My Website!&lt;/h1>
    &lt;p>Hello World!&lt;/p>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
    </code></pre>
    <p>If you don't understand the code, you can view the code explanation <a href="/programming/html/your-first-html-website/">here</a></p>
