    <h2>What is Input and Output?</h2>
    <p>In programming, input and output means communication between the computer and the human. This can take a number of forms.</p>
    <p>One example is a submit button on a form. When you click the button, you are communicating something with the computer, namely that you are submitting the form. This is input</p>
    <p>Once you submit the form, the computer responds with a success message. The computer is communicating with you.</p>
    <p>You will often see input and output abbreviated as input/output or simply I/O.</p>
    <p>In this tutorial, input and output will mean you entering something in the command line and the computer printing something back.</p>
