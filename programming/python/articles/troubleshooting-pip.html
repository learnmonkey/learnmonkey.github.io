<h1>Troubleshooting PIP</h1>
<p>If <code>pip install [package]</code> doesn't work for you, try the following commands: </p>
<ul>
    <li><code>python -m pip install [package]</code></li>
    <li><code>py -m pip install [package]</code></li>
    <li><code>python3 -m pip install [package]</code></li>
</ul>

<small>You need to have Python added to your Path in order to use PIP. If you don't, then reinstall Python but make sure to add it to your "Path". You can select that option in the Wizard Setup.</small>
