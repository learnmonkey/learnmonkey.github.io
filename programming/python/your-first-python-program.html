<h1>Your First Python Program</h1>
<p>Now, it's time for you to write your first program.</p>

    <h2>Writing the Program</h2>
    <p>To write our very first program, we will be using our freshly installed Sublime Text. First, open up Sublime Text, and you should the following screen: </p>

    <p>Inside of it, write <code><pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'><span style='color:#800000; font-weight:bold; '>print</span><span style='color:#808030; '>(</span><span style='color:#0000e6; '>"Hello World!"</span><span style='color:#808030; '>)</span></pre></code></p>

    <h2>Running the Program</h2>
    <p>Now, we need to save our Python program. To do this, press the Ctrl and S keys. You should see a window like the following pop up: </p>

    <p>Navigate to the folder you want your program to be in and enter a name for the text. It's important that the file ends in ".py". I'm calling mine <var>helloworld.py</var>.</p>
    <p>To run the program, press the Ctrl and B keys and choose "Python". You should see <samp>Hello World!</samp> printed at the bottom.</p>
