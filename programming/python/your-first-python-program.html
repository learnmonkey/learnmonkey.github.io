<h1>Your First Python Program</h1>
<p>Now, it's time for you to write your first program.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Writing The Program</h2>
    <p>Our very first program will simply print out "Hello World!" onto the screen. That might sound boring, but don't worry, in later lessons, you'll learn more advanced syntax.</p>
    <p>So, first, open up a text editor and make a file ending in .py. ".py" is the file extension for Python, which means that all of the file names for Python programs end in .py.</p>
    <p>You can name your file whatever you want, but in this tutorial, I'm calling it "helloworld.py".</p>
    <p>The program only has one line: <code>print("Hello World!")</code></p>
    <p>Finally, save the file wherever you want. We recommend making a folder called "My Python Programs" or something similar to that so you know where to store your code and where they are located.</p>

    <h2>Running The Program</h2>
    <p>Go into the terminal and navigate to the folder where you created your Python program.</p>
    <p>Then, execute the following command: </p>
    <code>python [filename].py</code>
    <p>This tells Python to run the Python program.</p>
    <p>After running the command, you should see the words "Hello World!" printed below your command.</p>
    <p>Yay! You've written and run your first Python program.</p>
