<h1>Python Tuples</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What are Tuples?</h2>
    <p>Tuples are the same as lists in most aspects. For example, you can put whatever you want in tuples and tuples are ordered. However, you can't change the tuple once you create it. In other words, tuples are <em>immutable</em>.</p>

    <h2>Making Tuples</h2>
    <p>It's the same as lists, but we use parentheses (<code>(</code> and <code>)</code>) instead of square brackets. We seperate the items in the tuple by commas. For example: </p>
    <code class="language-python">my_tuple = ("Learnmonkey", 43, True, 314.41)</code>
</section>

    <h2>Getting an Element</h2>
    <p>To access a tuple element, we type: </p>
    <code class="language-python"><i>tuple</i>[<i>index</i>]</code>
    <p><code><i>tuple</i></code> is the name of the tuple variable and <code><i>index</i></code> is the index of the element. Indexes start at zero for the first element and go up by one for each element. For example, the element with array index 2 is the third element and the element with array element 4 is the fifth element.</p>
    <p>For example: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
my_tuple = ("Learnmonkey", 43, True, 314.41)
print(my_tuple[0])
print(my_tuple[2])
print(my_tuple[3])
    </code></pre>
    <p>The above code returns: </p>
    <pre><samp>
Learnmonkey
True
314.41</samp></pre>
