<h1>Python Tuples</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What are Tuples?</h2>
    <p>Tuples are ordered collections of things, just like lists. You can also put any data type you want in a tuple and you can also mix data types. However, you can't change the tuple once you create it. In other words, tuples are <em>immutable</em>.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Making Tuples</h2>
    <p>It's the same as lists, but we use parentheses (<code>(</code> and <code>)</code>) instead of square brackets. We seperate the items in the tuple by commas. For example: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">my_tuple = ("Learnmonkey", 43, True, 314.41)</code></pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Getting an Element</h2>
    <p>To access a tuple element, we type: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"><i>tuple</i>[<i>index</i>]</code></pre>
    <p><code><i>tuple</i></code> is the name of the tuple variable and <code><i>index</i></code> is the index of the element. Indexes start at zero for the first element and go up by one for each element. For example, the element with array index 2 is the third element and the element with array element 4 is the fifth element.</p>
    <p>For example: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
my_tuple = ("Learnmonkey", 43, True, 314.41)
print(my_tuple[0])
print(my_tuple[2])
print(my_tuple[3])
    </code></pre>
    <p>The above code returns: </p>
    <pre><samp>
Learnmonkey
True
314.41</samp></pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Immutability</h2>
    <p>As said earlier, tuples are immutable (i.e. you can't change them once you make them). As an example, if we try and do something like: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
my_tuple = ("Learnmonkey", 43, True, 314.41)
my_tuple[0] = "Stack Overflow"
    </code></pre>
    <p>We get an error: </p>
    <samp style="color: red">TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment</samp>
    <p>However, this does not mean that we can't change the tuple attached to the tuple variable itself; variables can be changed to whatever we want. The only thing you can't do is to modify the current tuple stored in the variable, like changing the elements or adding and removing elements.</p>
