<h1>Python Tuples</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What are Tuples?</h2>
    <p>Tuples are the same as lists in most aspects. For example, you can put whatever you want in tuples. However, you cannot change the tuple whatsoever once you make it.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Lists?</h2>
    <p>It's the same as lists, but we use parentheses (<code>(</code> and <code>)</code>) instead of square brackets. We seperate the items in the tuple by commas.</p>

    <h2>Getting an Element</h2>
    <p>Getting an element is the exact same in tuples as in lists. We do <code>tuple[index]</code>, where <code>tuple</code> is the tuple variable and <code>index</code> is the index of the element. Indexes start at zero for the first element and go up by one for each element.</p>
