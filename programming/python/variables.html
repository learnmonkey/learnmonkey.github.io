<h1>Python Variables</h1>

    <h2>What are Variables?</h2>
    <p>Well, let's break down the word "variable". It sounds like the words "vary" and "able" chained together, right? So, the word variable means some thing that can be changed, or varied.</p>
    <p>You can think of a variable as a box and the name of the variable as box's label. You can't change the label, but you can change what's inside the box.</p>

    <h2>Why use Variables?</h2>
    <p>You might think that variables are super useless, but they are one of the most important things in all of programming. Why?</p>
    <p>Well, imagine you were programming a 2d-game. When making games, you need to know the position of the player. But you can't know the position. The player decides that. So, you put the position in a variable. Instead of checking the player's position every single time you need to check for collision, etc, you can just access the variable you have instead of using a long function to get the position of the player.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Variables?</h2>
    <p>It's actually very, very simple. Let's say that we want to declare a variable called <var>x</var> and set it to the value of 3.</p>
    <p>We just write <code><pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'>x <span style='color:#808030; '>=</span> <span style='color:#008c00; '>3</span></pre></code>. Simple, right. If we wanted a variable called <var>y</var> to have the value of 4, we write <code>y = 4</code>. Easy peasy.</p>
    <p>If we now want <var>x</var> to be 5, we just do <code><pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'>x <span style='color:#808030; '>=</span> <span style='color:#008c00; '>5</span></pre></code>. Nothing special.</p>

    <h2>A word a caution</h2>
    <p>In math class, our teacher told us that x = y is the same as y = x. That doesn't happen in programming. If we do <code><pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'><span style='color:#008c00; '>3</span> <span style='color:#808030; '>=</span> x
    </pre></code>, Python would interpret that as setting the value of 3 to x. Nonsense! So, Python would return an error.</p>
