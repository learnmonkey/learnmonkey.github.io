<h1>Python Variables</h1>

<section id="what-are-variables">
    <h2>What are Variables?</h2>
    <p>Well, let's break down the word "variable". It sounds like the words "vary" and "able" chained together, right? So, the word variable means some thing that can be changed, or varied.</p>
    <p>You can think of a variable as a box and the name of the variable as box's label. You can't change the label, but you can change what's inside the box.</p>

    <h2>Why use Variables?</h2>
    <p>You might think that variables are super useless, but they are one of the most important things in all of programming. Why?</p>
    <p>Well, imagine you were programming a 2d game. When making games, you need to know the position of the player. But you can't know the position. The player decides that. So, you put the position in a variable.</p>

    <h2>Using Variables</h2>
    <p>Let's say that we want to declare a variable called <code>x</code> and set it to the value of 3. We type:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">x = 3</code></pre>
    <p>If we now want a variable called <code>count</code> and set it to 10, we type:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">count = 10</code></pre>
    <p>If we now want our variable <code>x</code> to be equal to 5, we type:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">x = 5</code></pre>
</section>

<section id="a-word-of-caution">
    <h2>A word a caution</h2>
    <p>In math class, our teacher told us that x = y is the same as y = x. That's not true in programming. For example if we type, it's perfectly fine:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">x = 3</code></pre>
    <p>We're simply making a variable called <code>x</code> and setting it to 3.</p>
    <p>Now, see what happens when we type:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">3 = x</code></pre>
    <p>We're telling Python to set the value of 3 to <code>x</code>. Nonsense! So, Python gives us an error.</p>
