<h1>JavaScript Alerts</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is an Alert?</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, an alert is a little message box on the webpage. Alerts are great for testing JavaScript code since you do need to go to the console, but alerts should generally not be overused because the web page cannot be used until the alert is closed.</p>

    <h2>Making an Alert</h2>
    <p>To make alerts, we use the <code>alert()</code> function. You can run it from the console or a JavaScript file. For example, type the following code: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
alert("Hello World!")
    </code></pre>
    <p>You should see something like: </p>

    <h2>Making a Confirmation Alert</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, we also have the <code>confirm()</code> function. <code>confirm()</code> creates an alert box but with two buttons: OK and Cancel. If the user clicks OK, the function returns <code>true</code>. If the user clicks Cancel, the function returns <code>false</code>.</p>
    <p>As an example, type the following code: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log(confirm("Are you sure you want to do this?"))
    </code></pre>
    <p>When you run it, you should see something like this: </p>
    <img src="/images/programming/javascript/confirm-alert-example.png" alt="An example of a confirmation alert in JavaScript">
    <p>Click "OK". Now, go into the console. You should see <code>true</code>.</p>
    <p>If you do it again and click "Cancel", you should now see <code>false</code>.</p>
    <p>Just like normal alerts, you should not overuse confirmation alerts. They do not allow the user to interact with the page until they click "OK" or "Cancel".</p>

    <h2>Making a Prompt Alert</h2>
    <p>The final type of alert that JavaScript offers in the prompt alert, which uses the <code>prompt()</code> function. It allows the user to enter something in the alert. For example, write the following code: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log(prompt("Enter your favorite website:"))
    </code></pre>
    <p>When you run it, you should see something like this:</p>
    <img src="/images/programming/javascript/prompt-alert-example.png" alt="An example of a prompt alert in JavaScript">
    <p>Then, you can enter "Learnmonkey" and click OK. Now, when you look at the console, you should see <code>Learnmonkey</code>.</p>
    <p>Now, do the same thing again but click "Cancel" instead. Then, you should see <code>null</code>. <code>null</code> basically means an empty value or variable.</p>
