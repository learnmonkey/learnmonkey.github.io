    <h2>Getting a Code Editor</h2>
    <p>First of all, we will install a Code Editor, or a program that we can type our JavaScript into. If you already have a Code Editor like a Text Editor or IDE, just skip this part.</p>
    <p>One of the easiest to use Code Editors around is <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>. We will install that too. To do so, visit the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/download" target="_blank">Sublime Text Download Page</a> and select the download file for your operating system. Then, run through the Setup Wizard and you'll have Sublime Text installed!</p>
