<h1>JavaScript Console</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is the Console?</h2>
    <p>The console is basically a terminal for JavaScript in the web browser. We can also use the console as an interactive place to interact and experiment with JavaScript.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Opening the Console</h2>
    <p>It depends on the web browser. On Google Chrome, right click, select "Inspect Element" and switch to the "Console" tab. Then, you should see the console.</p>

    <h2>Printing to the Console</h2>
    <p>To print to the console, we use the <code>console.log()</code> function. As an example, go to any web page and open the console. In your console, type <code>console.log("Hello World!")</code>. You should something like the following (again, depends on web browser): </p>
    <img src="/images/programming/javascript/console-hello-world.png" alt="Hello World! in the console" style="height:75px">
    <p>Of course, we can also use <code>console.log()</code> in our JavaScript code files. As an example, type the following into your <code>script.js</code> file: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log("Running console.log from script.js")
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now, if you go into the console, you should see something like this: </p>
    <img src="/images/programming/javascript/console-script-js-example.png" alt="Running console.log() from script.js">
    <p><code>console.log()</code> is useful for testing purposes.</p>

    <h2>Making an Error in the Console</h2>
    <p>To make an error in the console, we use the <code>console.error()</code> function. For example: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">
console.error("You did something wrong!")
    </code></pre>
    <p>You should see: </p>
