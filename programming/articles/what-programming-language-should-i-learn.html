<h1>What Programming Language Should I Learn?</h1>

<section>
    <h2>My Recommendations</h2>
    <p>My recommendation is that you start with Python. That might be a little biased, since my main programming language is Python. However, there are many things supporting my argument. Python is quite simple but is very versatile and powerful and can do practically anything.</p>

    <h2>Does It Matter?</h2>
    <p>Honestly, it doesn't really matter. You don't <strong>have</strong> to learn Python, that's just my recommendation and you're welcome to not do it. You could also start with something like JavaScript or Ruby or C#. It doesn't matter that much since programming languages consist of mostly the same things and once you learn one language it's much easier to learn another one.</p>
