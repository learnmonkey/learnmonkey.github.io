<h1>Integrated Development Environments</h1>
<p>This article will be discussing the different ways you can edit your code.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Text Editors</h2>
    <p>The most basic way of writing code is to use a plain old text editor, like Notepad. However, I wouldn't recommend that because you would have to spend lots of time doing things like running your code or debugging your code. If you're programming in a language like Python, which uses indentation for syntax, it would be quite a pain to manage all the indentation.</p>
    <p>There are more advanced examples of text editors out there, like Atom or Notepad++, but they are still quite limited in their capabilities. For example, you need to get an extension in Atom to even run your code inside the editor.</p>
