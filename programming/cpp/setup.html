<h1>C++ Setup</h1>

<p>Before we can do anything with C++, we should have a compiler and a code editor. Luckily, the Code::Blocks IDE has both of those taken care of for us. So, go to <a href="https://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks's website</a> and navigate to the <a href="https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/">Doanloads</a> page. There, go to the <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/">binary releases</a> page and install the <code>codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe</code> file.</p>
