<h1>Introduction to C++</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is C++?</h2>
    <p>C++ is a low-level programming language which means that you can do things like directly manipulate memory. C++ is based on the C programming language, except C++ has classes and other things that <a href="/programming/c-lang/">C</a> does not have.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup as the successor to C. C++ is quite old compared to other programming languages, being released in</p>

    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p>C++ is very fast, so it is used in places where speed and efficiency are very important: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Games</li>
        <li>Operating Systems</li>
        <li>Animation</li>
        <li>Databases</li>
        <li>Compilers</li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Running C++</h2>
    <p>C++ is a compiled language which means that C++ takes your code and turns it into an executable, which is machine code that your computer can natively understand, no compiler or interpreter needed. Then, we run the executable.</p>
    <p>C++ has many compilers, but for this tutorial series we will be using the GCC compiler. Once we install GCC, we can use the <code>g++</code> command to compile our C++ code.</p>
