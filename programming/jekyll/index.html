<h1>Introduction to Jekyll</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is Jekyll?</h2>
    <p>Jekyll is a static site generator, which means we can write HTML, but without all the hassle. Using Jekyll, we can do things like use layouts and includes so we don't have to repeat ourselves, fancy templating for ease, and more. Jekyll is built using Ruby but you don't need any knowledge of Ruby to follow along.</p>
