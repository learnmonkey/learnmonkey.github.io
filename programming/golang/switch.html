<h1>Go Switch</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is a Switch Statements?</h2>
    <p>You can use a switch statement when you have lots of if and else if statements in your code. For example: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
if x == 1 {
    // do something
} else if x == 2 {
    // do something
} else if x == 3 {
    // do something
} else if x == 4 {
    // do something
}
// ... you get the idea
    </code></pre>
    <p>Instead, of this complicated, nasty code, we could have used a switch statement to save us lots of nasty code.</p>
    <p>Switch statements work by having different cases for what a variable might be. That way, we can put our conditional code in the cases.</p>

    <h2>Implementing the Switch Statement</h2>
    <p>Below is an example of what we could do to replace the earlier nasty code: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
switch x {
    case 1:
        // case where x is 1
    case 2:
        // case where x is 2
    case 3:
        // case where x is 3
    case 4:
        // case where x is 4
    // ... you get the idea
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>The very first line of our code is <code class="language-go">switch x {</code>, which tells Go that we are making a switch using the variable x. All of our cases will go inside the curly brackets.</p>
    <p>Then, we simply define all the cases using the syntax <code class="language-go">case [value]:</code> and then write the code for the case below it.</p>
