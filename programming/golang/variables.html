    <h1>What are Variables?</h1>
    <p>Well, let's break down the word "variable". It sounds like the words "vary" and "able" chained together, right? So, the word variable means some thing that can be changed, or varied.</p>
    <p>You can think of a variable as a box and the name of the variable as box's label. You can't change the label, but you can change what's inside the box.</p>

    <h2>Why use Variables?</h2>
    <p>You might think that variables are super useless, but they are one of the most important things in all of programming. Why?</p>
    <p>Well, imagine you were programming a 2d game. When making games, you need to know the position of the player. But you can't know the position. The player decides that. So, you put the position in a variable. Instead of checking the player's position every single time you need to check for collision, etc, you can just access the variable you have instead of using a long function to get the position of the player.</p>
