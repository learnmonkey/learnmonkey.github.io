    <h1>What are Variables?</h1>
    <p>Well, let's break down the word "variable". It sounds like the words "vary" and "able" chained together, right? So, the word variable means some thing that can be changed, or varied.</p>
    <p>You can think of a variable as a box and the name of the variable as box's label. You can't change the label, but you can change what's inside the box.</p>

    <h2>Why use Variables?</h2>
    <p>You might think that variables are super useless, but they are one of the most important things in all of programming. Why?</p>
    <p>Well, imagine you were programming a 2d game. When making games, you need to know the position of the player. But you can't know the position. The player decides that. So, you put the position in a variable. Instead of checking the player's position every single time you need to check for collision, etc, you can just access the variable you have instead of using a long function to get the position of the player.</p>

    <h2>Making Variables in Go</h2>
    <p>It's actually very easy to make variables in Go. Simply type <code>var [variable name]</code> to initialize an empty variable. If we want to initialize a variable and set it to a value, we type <code>var [variable name] = [value]</code>.</p>
    <small><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>When you first create a variable, you <strong>MUST</strong> use <code>var</code> or the short-declare operator (<code>:=</code>).</small><br>
    <small><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Once you make a variable, you <strong>HAVE</strong> to use it. If you don't, you'll get an error.</small>
    <p>Go is statically-typed, which means that the type of variable (integer, string, boolean, etc.) cannot change. When you make a variable, Go infers the type. Below is some code that will cause an error: </p>
    <pre><code>
var x = 3;
x = "Hello World!"
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>You could also make a new variable and give it a value without writing <code>var</code> by using a short-declare operator — <code>:=</code> — instead of an equals sign. For example: <code>var x = 3</code> is the same as <code>x := 3</code>. However, you cannot use <code>:=</code> once you have already defined a variable to change its value. Use <code>=</code> for that.</p>

    <h2>Explicit Variable Data Types</h2>
    <p>In Go, everything is statically-typed, meaning if you assign the variable to something other than when the variable's data type was when declared, you'll get an error. When we do something like <code>var x = 3</code>, Go is implicitly inferring that the data type is integer. If we then try and do <code>x = "some text"</code>, we get an error.</p>
    <p>In Go, we can also declare our variable types explicitly. For example, instead of doing <code>var x = 3</code>, we can do <code>var x int = 3</code>. This can be very useful when we are debugging our code.</p>
