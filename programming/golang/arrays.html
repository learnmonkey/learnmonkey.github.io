<h1>Go Arrays</h1>

    <h2>What is an Array?</h2>
    <p>An array is a list of values of the same data type of a fixed length. That way, instead of declaring seperate variables for each value, you could put it together into one variable. The values in an array can be called items or elements. This tutorial will use the term element.</p>
