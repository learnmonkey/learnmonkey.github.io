<h1>Go Pointers</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is a Pointer?</h2>
    <p>Pointers are variables that point to the memory address of another variable. The "memory" we are talking about here is the physical memory of the computer (i.e. hard drive). Pointers can also be found in C and C++.</p>

    <h2>Why use Pointers?</h2>
    <p>We can use pointers if we want to physically change the variables we want to pass into our function. However, it's usually best to use normal variables over pointers.</p>

    <h2>Making a Pointer</h2>
    <p>Below is the general format of making a pointer: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
var <i>variable-name</i> *<i>data-type</i>
    </code></pre>
    <p><code><i>variable-name</i></code> is the name of the pointer variable we want to make. <code>data-type</code> is the data type of the variable in the memory address we are referencing.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Getting the Address of a Variable</h2>
    <p>To get the address of a variable in Go, we put the ampersand symbol (<code>&</code>) before the variable. For example: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
var x int = 5
fmt.Println(&x)
    </code></pre>
    <p>The above code returns a hexadecimal number for the address of where the variable <code>x</code> is stored in memory: </p>
    <pre><samp>
0xc000016190
    </samp></pre>
    <p>We can also set the address to a pointer variable: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
var y int = 10
var y_addr *int
y_addr = &y
    </code></pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Getting the Data at a Memory Address</h2>
    <p>To get the data at the address, we use an asterisk (<code>*</code>) yet again. If we type <code>*x</code>, we are referring to the value stored at the piece of memory that the <code>x</code> variable is pointing to.</p>
    <p>For example: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    var myInt = 5 // declare an integer variable called myInt
    var myPtr *int = &x // declare a pointer variable that points to the memory location of myInt
    fmt.Println(*myPtr) // get the data stored at the memory address myPtr is pointing to
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>The above code returns: </p>
    <pre><samp>
5
    </samp></pre>

    <h2>Indirect Assignments</h2>
    <p>When we ask Go to change the value of a variable, up to now Go has been changing the data inside the memory that the variable is pointing to. However, we can also change the piece of memory that the variable is pointing to. This is called indirectly assignment. The format is: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">

    </code></pre>
