<h1>Go Pointers</h1>

    <h2>What is a Pointer?</h2>
    <p>Pointers are variables that point to the memory address of another variable. The "memory" we are talking about here is the physical memory of the computer (i.e. hard drive). Pointers can also be found in C and C++.</p>

    <h2>Making a Pointer</h2>
    <p>Below is the general format of making a pointer: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
var <i>variable-name</i> *<i>data-type</i>
    </code></pre>
    <p><code><i>variable-name</i></code> is the name of the pointer variable we want to make. <code>data-type</code> is the data type of the variable in the memory address we are referencing.</p>

    <h2>Getting the Address of a Variable</h2>
    <p>To get the address of a variable in Go, we put the ampersand symbol (<code>&</code>) before the variable. For example: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
var x int = 5
fmt.Println(&x)
    </code></pre>
    <p>The above code returns a hexadecimal number for the address of where the variable <code>x</code> is stored in memory: </p>
    <pre><samp>
0xc000016190
    </samp></pre>
    <p>We can also set the address to a pointer variable: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
var y int = 10
var y_addr *int
y_addr = &y
    </code></pre>
