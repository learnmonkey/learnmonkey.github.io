<h1>Printing In Go</h1>

<section>
	<h2>What is Printing?</h2>
	<p>In the last tutorial when we made our first program, we wrote <samp>Hello, World!</samp> in the <i>Terminal/Command Prompt</i>. In programming, we call this <u>printing</u>. Printing is an essential but basic part of programming; It's just writing text in the console. If we wanted to create a text-based game, we would use print to show the text in the terminal.</p>
