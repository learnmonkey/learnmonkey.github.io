<h1>Go For Loop</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is a Loop?</h2>
    <p>In programming, we have "loops". So, what are loops? Well, think about a loop as doing the same thing over and over again, like a loop in regular life! Loops can run as many times as you want. Even infinitely!</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why use loops?</h2>
    <p>Well, as an example, let's say that you want to print <samp>Hello World!</samp> 5 times. We already know that the code for one <samp>Hello World!</samp> is:</p><pre><code class="language-go">fmt.Println("Hello World!")</code></pre>.<p>Sure, you could copy and paste the code 5 times, it's not a lot, but hat if you wanted to print <samp>Hello World!</samp> 1000 times? That's when the power of loops comes in!! Instead of writing 1000 lines of code, we can only write a few!</p>

	<h2>What is a For Loop?</h2>
    <p>A for loop in programming is a loop that loops a certain number of times. It can <i>iterate</i>, or loop over, an array or any other iterable (array, slices, etc.).</p>

	<h2>Making For Loops in Go</h2>
    <p>In Go, we can make for loops by using the <code>for</code> keyword. The syntax for Go for loops is:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
for <i>initialization</i>; <i>condition<i>; <i>update</i> {
    // looped code goes here
}
    </code></pre>
    <p><code><i>initialization</i></code> initializes a loop counter variable. <code><i>condition</i></code> is the condition that has to be met in order for the loop counter to be initialized. Finally, <code><i>update</i></code> updates the loop counter.</p>
    <small><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>Remember to put the three parts in the correct order! If you do something like <code>for <i>initialization</i>; <i>update<i>; <i>condition</i></code> your code will run forever!</small>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
package main

import "fmt"
        
func main() {
    for i := 0; i =&lt; 10; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>After running this code, the result is:</p>
    <pre><samp>
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
    </samp></pre>p
    <p>In the code, we declare a loop counter called <code>i</code> and set it to zero. While <code>i</code> is smaller than 10, we keep adding one to <code>i</code> and printing out <code>i</code>.</p>
    <p>We could have done something like this too:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 10; i >= 0; i-- {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>The above code returns: </p>
    <pre><samp>
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
0
    </samp></pre>
