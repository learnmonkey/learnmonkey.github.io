<h1>Go For Loop</h1>

    <h2>What is a Loop?</h2>
    <p>In programming, we have "loops". So, what are loops? Well, think about a loop as doing the same thing over and over again, like a loop in regular life! Loops can run as many times as you want. Even infinitely!</p>

    <h2>Why use loops?</h2>
    <p>Well, as an example, let's say that you want to print <samp>Hello World!</samp> 5 times. We already know that the code for one <samp>Hello World!</samp> is:</p><pre><code class="language-go">fmt.Println("Hello World!")</code></pre>.<p>Sure, you could copy and paste the code 5 times, it's not a lot, but hat if you wanted to print <samp>Hello World!</samp> 1000 times? That's when the power of loops comes in!! Instead of writing 1000 lines of code, we can only write a few!</p>
