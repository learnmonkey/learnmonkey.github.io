<h1>Go For Loop</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is a Loop?</h2>
    <p>In programming, we have "loops". So, what are loops? Well, think about a loop as doing the same thing over and over again, like a loop in regular life! Loops can run as many times as you want. Even infinitely!</p>

    <h2>Why use loops?</h2>
    <p>Well, as an example, let's say that you want to print <samp>Hello World!</samp> 5 times. We already know that the code for one <samp>Hello World!</samp> is:</p><pre><code class="language-go">fmt.Println("Hello World!")</code></pre>.<p>Sure, you could copy and paste the code 5 times, it's not a lot, but hat if you wanted to print <samp>Hello World!</samp> 1000 times? That's when the power of loops comes in!! Instead of writing 1000 lines of code, we can only write a few!</p>

	<h2>What is a For Loop?</h2>
    <p>A For Loop in programming is a loop that loops a certain number of times. It can <i>iterate</i>, or loop over, an array or any other iterable (array, slices, etc.).</p>

	<h2>Making For Loops in Go</h2>
    <p>In Go, we can make For Loops by using the <code>for</code> keyword. The syntax for Go For Loops is:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
for initialization; condition; update {
    // looped code goes here
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>As an example, type the following code into a <code>.go</code> file:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
        package main

        import "fmt"
        
        func main() {
            for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
                fmt.Println(i)
            }
        }
    </code></pre>
    <p>After running this code, the result is:</p>
    <pre><samp>
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
    </samp></pre>
