	<h2>Why use Go?</h2>
	<p>Although Go is relatively new, it is gaining popularity quickly. Go is statically-typed so it is fast, like C, but it also has similar syntax to C and can do many of the same things as C, but with things like memory safety, garbage collection, and more. It was designed to be readable, like Python or JavaScript.</p>
