<h1>Your First Go Program</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Writing the Code</h2>
    <p>Now, it's time to get our hands dirty and write some actual code. Below is the code we're going to write: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>Save this file as something that ends in <code>.go</code>.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Running the Code</h2>
    <p>Go into the terminal/command line and type the following command: </p>
    <pre>go run [filename].go</pre>
    <p>This tells the Go compiler to run the file. Once you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, you should see the following result: </p>
    <samp>Hello, World!</samp>
</section>

    <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
    <p><code>package main</code> tells Go that we are making a program that we are going to run, not something like a library.</p>
    <p><code>import "fmt"</code> tells Go to import the <code>fmt</code> library, which includes basic functionality.</p>
    <p><code>func main() {</code> tells Go that we are declaring a function called <code>main</code>. If you don't know what a function is, don't panic. Just know that Go runs the code in the main function.</p>
    <p><code>fmt.Println("Hello, World!")</code> tells Go to go into the <code>fmt</code> library and find the function <code>Println</code>, which prints the text <code>Hello, World</code> onto the screen. The <code>ln</code> in <code>Println</code> is for 
    "line", so Go adds a newline to the end of our text.</p>
    <p><code>}</code> tells Go to end the <code>main</code> function. If you don't add it, you'll get an error.</p>
