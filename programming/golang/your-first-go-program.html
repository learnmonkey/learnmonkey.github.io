    <h2>Writing the Code</h2>
    <p>Now, it's time to get our hands dirty and write some actual code. Below is the code we're going to write: </p>
    <pre><code>
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>Save this file as something that ends in <code>.go</code>.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Running the Code</h2>
    <p>Go into the terminal/command line and type the following command: </p>
    <pre>go run [filename].go</pre>
    <p>This tells the Go compiler to run the file. Once you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, you should see the following result: </p>
    <samp>Hello, World!</samp>
