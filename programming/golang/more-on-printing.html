<h1>Printing In Go</h1>

<section>
	<h2>What is Printing?</h2>
	<p>In the last tutorial when we made our first program, we wrote <samp>Hello, World!</samp> in the <i>Terminal/Command Prompt</i>. In programming, we call this <u>printing</u>. Printing is an essential but basic part of programming; It's just writing text in the console. If we wanted to create a text-based game, we would use print to show the text in the terminal.</p>

	<h2>How can I print text in Go?</h2>
	<p>We already know that we can simply write <code class="language-go">fmt.Println(<i>text</i>)</code> to print stuff in Go. We can change text to be any <a href="/programming/golang/data-types/">Data Type</a> we want (to learn more about Data Types, click the link to see our Data Types tutorial)!</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>There are many ways you can use the Go <code>fmt.Println</code> <i>function</i></p>
	<p>First, you can simply put the text as a string.</p>
	<p>For example, some examples of doing this are:</p>
	<code class="language-go">fmt.Println("Share Learnmonkey with your friends")</code><br>
	<code class="language-go">fmt.Println("qwerty")</code>
	<br><br>
	<p>We can also use <code>fmt.Println</code> to print a number: an integer or decimal(floating point). To do that, we can write <code>fmt.Println(<i>number</i>)</code>.</p>
	<p>For example, that could look like:</p>
	<code class="language-go">fmt.Println(36257265)</code><br>
	<code class="language-go">fmt.Println(973.256347)</code>
	<br><br>
	<p>Finally, we can place different Data Types in the function, seperated with commas like this:</p>
	<code class="language-go">fmt.Println("My", "Name", "Is", "Joe")</code>
	<p>This will tell the <code>fmt.Println</code> function to print each of the strings but sperated with spaces so the end result will be: <samp>My Name Is Joe</samp>.</p>

	<h2>The <code>fmt.Print</code> Function</h2>
	<p>In addition to <code>Println</code>, Go also has a <code>Print</code>. The <code>ln</code> in <code>Println</code> actually stands for line, so Go makes a new line after every <code>Println</code> statement. The <code>Print</code> function doesn't make a new line. Also, when you do <code class="language-go">fmt.Print("Hello","World")</code> you get <samp>HelloWorld</samp> instead of <samp>Hello World</samp>. You can do everything else the same.</p>

	<h2>The <code>fmt.Printf</code> function</h2>
	<p>The <code>Printf()</code> function uses a pre-defined format for the output, in which we can put variables.</p>
