    <h2>If Statements</h2>
    <p>If statements are when we want to execute some lines of code only when a specific condition is met. Below is the basic structure of a Go if statement:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
if [condition] {
    // do something
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>We replace <code>[condition]</code> with the condition we want to test. Then, inside the curly brackets, we put our code. The code is only run if the condition is met.</p>
