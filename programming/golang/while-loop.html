<h1>Go While Loop</h1>

    <h2>What is a While Loop?</h2>
    <p>A while loop like an if statement, but it runs as long as that condition is true, instead of just running it once.</p>

    <h2>Making a While Loop</h2>
    <p>Actually, the title of this tutorial is quite misleading since Go has no while loops. This tutorial was only created because we couldn't find a place to put it in the tutorial on for loops. Instead, Go uses the for loop to replace the while loop, which is a seperate loop in some other programming languages. Below is the syntax: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
for <i>condition</i> {
    // code to keep repeating
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>Something like the below would run indefintely: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-go">
for true {
    // the code inside the loop runs forever
}
    </code></pre>
