    <h2>The Planets</h2>
    <p>To find all the planets, we need to first define a planet. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined a planet (in the Solar System) to be anything that fits these requirements: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The object <em>orbits</em> the Sun</li>
        <li>The object needs to be similar to a sphere</li>
        <li>The object must have enough gravity to clear the space surrounding it</li>
    </ol>
