    <h2>How Stars Produce Energy</h2>
    <p>Stars produce their energy via a process called <em>nuclear fusion</em>, which works by squeezing together hydrogen atoms until they turn into a helium atom. This releases a huge amount of energy. This reaction is called the proton-proton chain reaction. Nuclear fusion happens in the core of stars.</p>
