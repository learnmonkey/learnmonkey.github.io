<h1>Capacitors</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What are Capacitors?</h2>
    <p>Capacitors store electricity, just like batteries. The difference is that capacitors charge and release electricity much faster. This is because capacitors store electricity using electric fields, while batteries use chemistry.</p>

    <h2>Capacitance</h2>
    <p>The effect of a capacitor is called <em>capacitance</em>. We measure capacitance in <em>farads</em> (symbol: F).</p>

    <h2>How Capacitors Work</h2>
    <p>Capacitors consist of two metal plates stuck very close together with an insulator between them.</p>
