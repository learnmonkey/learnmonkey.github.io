<h1>Capacitors</h1>

<p>Capacitors store electricity, just like batteries. The difference is that capacitors charge and release electricity much faster. This is because capacitors store electricity using electric fields, while batteries use chemistry.</p>
<p>The effect of a capacitor is called <em>capacitance</em>. We measure capacitance in <em>farads</em>.</p>
