    <h2>What is Electrical Power?</h2>
    <p>Electrical power is the rate of electrical energy that something uses or produces. Electrical power can be calculated using the following formula: </p>
    <blockquote>Power = Current x Voltage</blockquote>
    <p>You will most often see the formula as: </p>
    <blockquote>P = IV</blockquote>

    <h2>Using the Electrical Power Equation</h2>
    <p>The electrical power equation is quite useful because the electrical power output of something or the electrical power used by something remains the same when we change the voltage or current. This is why power stations use really high voltage. </p>
