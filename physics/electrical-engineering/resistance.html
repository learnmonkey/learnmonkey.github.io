<h1>Resistance</h1>

<p><em>Resistance</em> is a measure of how much something blocks electricity. You can think of resistance as friction for electricity.</p>
<p>Since we don't live in a perfect world, everything has resistance. Even the wires have resistance, albeit very low resistance.</p>
<p>We can add resistance on purpose with <em>resistors</em>. Resistors are can be used for limiting the amount of current when dealing with sensitive electrical components, such as LEDs.</p>
<small>Fun fact: resistors have colored bars on them which depend on the resistance.</small>
