    <h2>What are Semiconductors?</h2>
    <p>In addition to conductors and insulators, there is also the less common <em>semiconductor</em>. Semiconductors conduct electricity better than insulators, but worse than conductors. Semiconductors are used in <a href="/physics/electrical-engineering/diodes/">diodes</a> and <a href="/physics/electrical-engineering/transistors/">transistors</a>.</p>
    <p>Some examples of semiconductors are silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium. Silicon is the most popular semiconductor, with gallium arsenide second.</p>

    <h2>How Semiconductors Work</h2>
    <p>In the <a href="/physics/electrical-engineering/conductors-insulators/">conductors and insulators tutorial</a>, we introduced the idea of the valence and conduction bands. In a semiconductor, the valence and conduction bands are close together, but they don't overlap.</p>
