    <h2>What are Circuits?</h2>
    <p>A <em>circuit</em> is a loop that electrons can travel through. If we don't make it a loop, the electrons can't travel. Circuits include a source of electricity, like a battery. Circuits also generally include a load, which is something that uses up electricity, like a light bulb.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Circuits</h2>
    <p>Below is an example of a circuit. It has a source of electricity (battery) and a load (light bulb): </p>
    <p>We can also add a switch to the circuit: </p>
    <p>We can even have two light bulbs: </p>
