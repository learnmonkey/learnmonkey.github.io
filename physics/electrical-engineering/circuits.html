<section>
    <h2>What are Circuits?</h2>
    <p>A <em>circuit</em> is a loop that electrons can travel through. If we don't make it a loop, the electrons can't travel. Circuits include a source of electricity, like a battery. Circuits also generally include a load, which is something that uses up electricity, like a light bulb.</p>
    <p>The components of circuits are called <em>electric components</em>.</p>
    <p>We can also have a switch. A switch blocks the flow of the electrons. If the electrons are blocked, we call the circuit an <em>open circuit</em>. If the electrons are flowing, we call the circuit a <em>closed circuit</em>.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Circuits</h2>
    <p>Below is an example of a circuit. It has a source of electricity (battery) and a load (light bulb): </p>

    <p>We can also add a switch to the circuit: </p>

    <p>We can even have two light bulbs: </p>

    <h2>Parallel and Series Circuits</h2>
    <p>A series circuit is a circuit where all of the electrical components are connected on the same wire. One disadvantage is that if one component fails, the electrons stop flowing and none of the others can work: </p>

    <p>A parallel circuit is where all of the electrical components are connected in parallel to each other. One advantage is that if one component fails, all the others can operate: </p>
