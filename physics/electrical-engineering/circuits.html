    <h2>What are Circuits?</h2>
    <p>A <em>circuit</em> is a loop that electrons can travel through. If we don't make it a loop, the electrons can't travel. Circuits include a source of electricity, like a battery. Circuits also generally include a load, which is something that takes up electricity, like a light bulb.</p>
