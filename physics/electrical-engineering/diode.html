    <h2>What is a Diode?</h2>
    <p><em>Diodes</em> are electrical components that block the flow of electricity in one direction, but allow it in the opposite direction. The direction in which the diode blocks electricity is called the <em>reverse direction</em>, while the opposite direction is called the <em>forward direction</em>.</p>
