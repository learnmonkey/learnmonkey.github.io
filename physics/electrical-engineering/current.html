<h1>Current</h1>

<p>In electrical engineering, <em>current</em> is the rate of electricity (usually electrons) that is flowing past a point in a circuit.</p>
<p>If you think of the electricity as water flow, current is how much water is flowing through a point in the pipe every second.</p>
<p>The SI unit for measuring current is the <em>ampere</em> (also called an <em>amp</em>). An ampere is defined as one coulomb per second. We measure current using an <em>ammeter</em>.</p>
