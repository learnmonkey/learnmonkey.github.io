    <h2>What is a Circuit Diagram?</h2>
    <p>A circuit diagram is used by electrical engineers to more easily represent circuits. Instead of using illustrations of the electrical components, circuit diagrams use abstract shapes.</p>

    <h2>Electrical Components in Circuit Diagrams</h2>
    <p>In this section, we will learn how to represent some common electrical components in circuit diagrams.</p>

        <figcaption>A <a href="/physics/electrical-engineering/batteries/">battery</a> in a circuit diagram. Batteries are represented as four lines with alternating lengths. The longest line on the end is the positive terminal, while the shortest line on the end is the negative terminal.</figcaption>
