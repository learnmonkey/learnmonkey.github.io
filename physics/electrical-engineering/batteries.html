    <h2>What is a Battery?</h2>
    <p>A battery stores electrical energy using chemistry. There are many different types of battery like lithium-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, and more. Some batteries are rechargeable and others are not.</p>

    <h2>How Batteries Work</h2>
    <p>Batteries have three parts: the <em>anode</em>, the <em>cathode</em>, and the <em>electrolyte</em>. The anode is negatively charged, so the negative electrons are pushed away from it. The cathode has a positive charge, so the electrons are attracted to the cathode. The electrolyte is in between the anode and the cathode. The electrolyte allows ions to flow through it, thus moving the electron. The specifics of the three parts work because of chemistry, which is specific to the type of battery.</p>
