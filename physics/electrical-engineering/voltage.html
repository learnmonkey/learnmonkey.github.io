<h1>Voltage</h1>

<p><em>Voltage</em> is the amount of pressure between two points in a circuit. This pressure is applied by the power source in order to push the electrons around the circuit.</p>
<p>The unit for measuring voltage is the volt. We use voltmeters to measure voltage between two points in a circuit.</p>
