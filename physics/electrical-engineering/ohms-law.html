<h1>Ohm's Law</h1>

<section id="what-is-ohms-law">
    <h2>What is Ohm's Law?</h2>
    <p>Ohm's law relates voltage, current, and resistance in a nice, simple equation: </p>
    <blockquote>Voltage = Current x Resistance</blockquote>
    <p>Voltage is usually abbreviated as <var>V</var>, current as <var>I</var>, and resistance as <var>R</var>. So, you will usually see Ohm's law written as: </p>
    <blockquote>V = IR</blockquote>
    <p>Ohm's law is named after German physicist Georg Ohm, who published this equation in 1827.</p>

    <h2>Using Ohm's Law</h2>
    <p>If we know current and resistance, we can calculate the voltage using Ohm's law:</p>
    <blockquote>V = IR</blockquote>
    <p>If we know voltage and resistance, we can calculate the current by dividing both sides of Ohm's law by the resistance:</p>
    <blockquote>I = V/R</blockquote>
    <p>If we know voltage and current, we can calculate resistance by dividing both sides of Ohm's law by current:</p>
    <blockquote>R = V/I</blockquote>
    <p>Resistance can't be measured while a circuit is operating, so if we need the resistance, we can simply use Ohm's law.</p>
