    <h2>What is Ohm's Law?</h2>
    <p>Ohm's law relates voltage, current, and resistance in a nice, simple equation: </p>
    <blockquote>Voltage = Current x Resistance</blockquote>
    <p>Voltage is usually abbreviated as <var>V</var>, current as <var>I</var>, and resistance as <var>R</var>. So, you will usually see Ohm's law written as: </p>
    <blockquote>V = IR</blockquote>
    <p>Ohm's law is named after German physicist Georg Ohm, who published this equation in 1827.</p>
