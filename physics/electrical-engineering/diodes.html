    <h2>What is a Diode?</h2>
    <p><em>Diodes</em> are electrical components that block the flow of electricity in one direction, but allow it in the opposite direction. The direction in which the diode blocks electricity is called the <em>reverse direction</em>, while the opposite direction is called the <em>forward direction</em>.</p>

    <h2>How Diodes Work</h2>
    <p>Diodes are made of <a href="/physics/electrical-engineering/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a>. In particular, the are made up of a p-type doped semiconductor stuck onto an n-type doped semiconductor.</p>
    <p>If you run the electricity in the forward direction, the electrons in the n-type side move to fill the holes in the p-type side and the electricity flows.</p>
    <p>However, if you have the electricity go in the reverse direction, the electrons and the electron holes are drawn to either side and no electricity will flow.</p>

    <p>Light emitting diodes are a type of diode that emit light when current is run through it.</p>
