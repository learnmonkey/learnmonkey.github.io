    <h2>What are Translations?</h2>
    <p>A Translation is a Transformation in which you move a shape left, up, right, down, or diagonally, but doing the same Translation to each point on the shape. You <b>MUST</b> not mess up or forget any points, or the Translation will not be correct.</p>

    <h2>Different Translations</h2>
    <p>There are <u>three</u> main transformations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Translation</li>
        <li>The Reflection</li>
        <li>The Rotation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, there are also some other Translations like Dilations but these are the main ones.</p>
