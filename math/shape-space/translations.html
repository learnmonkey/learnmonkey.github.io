    <h2>Different Translations</h2>
    <p>There are <u>three</u> main transformations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Translation</li>
        <li>The Reflection</li>
        <li>The Rotation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, there are also some other Translations like Dilations but these are the main ones.</p>
