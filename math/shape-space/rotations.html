    <h2>What are Rotations?</h2>
    <p>A Reflection is a Transformation in which you rotate a shape around a point. The point doesn't have to be touching the shape, it can be anywhere on a graph.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Here are a few examples of Rotations:</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Example #1</h3>
        <img src="/math/shape-space/rotation1.png" alt="Rotation Example Image">
        <p>In this example, we <i>rotate</i> the square around the point. We can tell how it is rotated by the text on the square.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Example #2</h3>
        <img src="/math/shape-space/rotation2.png" alt="Rotation Example Image">
        <p>In this example, we <i>rotate</i> the cat around the point. We can call this a "90 degree clockwise rotate around the point".</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Example #3</h3>
        <img src="/math/shape-space/rotation3.png" alt="Rotation Example Image">
        <p>In this example, we <i>rotate</i> the cat around the point. It's the same as the previous example, except that we rotate it 180 degrees instead of 90. We can call this a "180 degree rotate around the point".</p>
