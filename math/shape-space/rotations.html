    <h2>What are Rotations?</h2>
    <p>Transformation is very important in Shape and Space. It involves moving different shapes, both 2D and 3D, in different ways. In this tutorial, we'll learn about them.</p>

    <h2>Different Rotations</h2>
    <p>There are <u>three</u> main transformations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Translation</li>
        <li>The Reflection</li>
        <li>The Rotation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, there are also some other Rotations like Dilations but these are the main ones.</p>
