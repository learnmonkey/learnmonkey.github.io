    <h2>What are Reflections?</h2>
    <p>A Reflection is a Transformation in which you reflect a shape over a line. It's similar to viewing it through a mirror. It can seem upside down or flipped over.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Here are a few examples of Reflections:</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Example #1</h3>
        <img src="/math/shape-space/reflection1.png" alt="Reflection Example Image">
        <p>In this example, we <i>reflect</i> the square over the line. It looks we only translated it, because the square is symmetric, but if we used a triangle, it would be easy to see how we reflected the square.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Example #2</h3>
        <img src="/math/shape-space/reflection2.png" alt="Reflection Example Image">
        <p>In this example, we <i>reflect</i> the triangle over the line. Unlike the previous example, we can easily see how it is reflected, because of the point at the top.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Example #3</h3>
        <img src="/math/shape-space/reflection3.png" alt="Reflection Example Image" style="height:200%;width:200%;">
        <!-- <p>In this example, we <i>translate</i> the triangle 10 units down, meaning that we move it down without messing with how the shape looks so the triangle still looks the same.</p> -->
