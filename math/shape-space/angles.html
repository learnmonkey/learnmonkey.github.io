    <h2>What are Angles?</h2>
    <p>An <b>Angle</b> is the space between two rays, at the point where the meet, called the <i>vertex</i>.</p>

    <h2>Measuring Angles</h2>
    <p>Angles are measured in degrees and radians. However, you only need to know radians in higher math levels so degrees is the dominant measure of angles.</p>

        <h3>Degrees</h3>
        <p>Degrees are the measure for angles. Some uses of degrees in real life is measuring spins, like a 360, </p>

    <h2>Different Angles</h2>
    <p>There are 4 main types of angles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Acute Angle</li>
        <li>Right Angle</li>
        <li>Obtuse Angle</li>
        <li>Straight Angle</li>
        <li>Reflex Angle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An Acute Angle is an angle that is less than 90&deg;</p>
    <p>A Right Angle is an angle that is exactly 90&deg;</p>
    <p>An Obtuse Angle is an angle that is greater than 90&deg; but less than 180&deg;</p>
    <p>A Straight Angle is an angle that is exactly 180&deg;</p>
    <p>A Reflex Angle is an angle that is greater than 180&deg;</p>
    <p>Another thing to remember is that a 360&deg; angle is a circle.</p>
