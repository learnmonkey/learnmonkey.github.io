<h1>Triangles</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll learn about <b>Triangles</b>.</p>

<section>
    <h2>What are Triangles?</h2>
    <p>Triangles are Polygons that have three sides. We can classify Triangles based on sides and angles, as shown below.</p>

    <h2>Classifying Triangles</h2>
    <p>You can classify Triangles based on sides and angles.</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Classifying by Sides</h3>
        <p>You can classify triangles by sides depending on the number of equal sides.</p>
        <p>A triangle is <i>scalene</i> if the length of all of the sides are not equal to each other.</p>
        <p>A triangle is <i>isosceles</i> if there are at least two equal sides in the triangle.</p>
        <p>A triangle is <i>equilateral</i> if all of the sides are equal. An equilateral triangle is also isosceles.</p>

        <h3>Classifying by Angles</h3>
        <p>You can also classify a triangle based on its angles by what type they are (acuta, obtuse, right).</p>
