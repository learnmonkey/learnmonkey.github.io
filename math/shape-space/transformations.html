    <h2>What are Transformations?</h2>
    <p>Transformation is very important in Shape and Space. It involves moving different shapes, both 2D and 3D, in different ways. In this tutorial, we'll learn about them.</p>

    <h2>Different Transformations</h2>
    <p>There are <u>three</u> main transformations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/math/shape-space/translations/">The Translation</a></li>
        <li><a href="/math/shape-space/reflections/">The Reflection</a></li>
        <li><a href="/math/shape-space/rotations/">The Rotation</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, there are also some other Transformations like Dilations but these are the main ones.</p>
